**Introduction**

Communication is one of the most important parts of our daily lives. 
For people who are deaf or hard of hearing, sign language is a powerful way to express themselves. 
However, not everyone understands sign language, which can lead to communication barriers in everyday 
situations like schools, hospitals, or public places.
With the help of technology, especially computer vision and deep learning, we now have the ability 
to teach machines to understand visual information like hand gestures. This project, 
SignLanguageDetection, focuses on recognizing hand gestures used in sign language. 
The goal is to take a small step toward bridging the gap between sign language users and non-signers, 
making communication more inclusive and accessible for everyone.
